# OLD CONFIG FILES


Just my config for nixos + bspwm w/picom and polybar.
im new to nix so if something seems wack, make a pull request or dm me on discord, i'd really appreciate it.
(if some of my keybindings in bspwm or other apps seem weird, it's because i use [semimak](https://semilin.github.io/blog/2021/semimak.html).)
